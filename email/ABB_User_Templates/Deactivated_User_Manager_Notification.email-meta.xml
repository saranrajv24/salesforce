    <subject>Your subordinate’s Salesforce user is deactivated</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!User.Manager},  

You received this message, because Salesforce user {!User.Username} (Organization ID {!Organization.Id} ) has just been deactivated and you are set up as his user’s manager. If there are any valid business records assigned to user, you are responsible for re-assignment them to new owner.   
If you need support with re-assigning objects, please contact your local Salesforce administrator. 

Thank you,  
SFDC Team</textOnly>
